## test-deploy project

Intended to practice connecting an app to render.com, which allows for connecting a database to a deployed site.

_vercel and github pages are only designed for front-end deployment and so can't be used in conjunction with connecting to MongoDB._

For this lesson also check out the cloned repo of the fruits app here:
```/c/Users/Natrix/SEI-920/unit2/week10/fruits/fruit-express-mongo```
^^^ This project is where most of the subsequent work for week 10 is going to happen.
